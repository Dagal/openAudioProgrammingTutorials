    JackClient

What we're going to do today is create a simple JACK client. Its going
to create 2 ports, one input, and one output. Then it will copy the data
from one port to the other.

This is essentially a useless JACK client, but it provides a good
overview of how JACK programming works, and this basic functionality
is essential for any fancy programs: read Ardour, QTractor, QSynth,
Yoshimi etc *all* have a JACK process callback just like this one!
