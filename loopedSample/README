    Looped Sample

This tutorial will show you how to load a sample into memory, and then
play it back trough a JACK port, continually looping. There's not really
that much to it, just a bit of thinking of the order things happen, and
arrays. If you've read the "Writing a sample" tutorial, you'll already
be familiar with LibSndFile, the library we use to read / write samples,
so there's nothing too hard to handle :)
