    Gui FFT Analyzer

This tutorial will show you how to dump audio from the JACK thread to the
GUI thread, then perform FFT analysis of it, and show it in a widget :)

Steps:
1. Get audio data: A JACK input will provide a stream of audio
2. Move data to non-rt thread
3. Analyse data, using KissFFT library
4. Plot resulting data on a custom widget
