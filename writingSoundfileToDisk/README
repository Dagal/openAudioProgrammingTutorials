    Writing Soundfile To Disk

This short tutorial will show you how to write a buffer of audio that's
in memory to disk. We use a library called Libsndfile for this purpose,
its a great library to read and write a variety of soundfile formats.

So if you haven't done so yet, you'll need to install libsndfile-dev or
similar to allow you link your C++ program against that library. Note
that we're going to use the C++ wrapper around the C library, and hence
we're including <sndfile.hh>
