    Ladspa Host

For this tutorial we're going to have to use some slightly more advanced
features of glibmm, loading a plugin file, and then retrieving the
LADSPA details from it.

Once we have instantiated the plugin (created one processing "unit")
then we "connect" the ports of the plugin to the variables of the host,
and finally we tell it to run for "nframes" amount of audio samples.

So the structure is pretty logical:

    Load .so plugin file from disk
    Retrieve details of plugin from file handle
    Instantiate plugin
    connect ports
    run the plugin
