        Linux Audio Programming Documentation

This repo exists as a place to leave example code that belongs
to some tutorials in the FlossManual. We are using git as a way to keep
track of versions of tutorials, and allow easy updating of content for
two reasons:

1. It makes adding code, and editing code much easier for authors
2. It is how a lot of projects collaberate, and as such is an important
   step in learning Linux Audio Programming!
